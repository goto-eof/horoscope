# horoscope
A complete horoscope web service that I written, which will be integrated with alexa. The application provides an REST API.
I used Spring Boot, spring data jpa, Hibernate and MySQL.

In order to run it, make a maven clean install and then run as Spring Boot application. 

Then call the endpoint with postman to retrieve some informations: http://localhost:8080/horoscope/sign/${YOUR_SIGN}
